description: >-
  Challenge Ids are a mix of signature challenge Ids, which are present in the
  game files and picked Challenges, which ids are generated on the fly by the
  game on UpdateMetadataGroups.


  Here are some example ids from signature challenges:

  ```json

  [
  	"B4B156CC47C8D987B9BDBEB910B12C9E",
  	"00c0407c47e60cdb558c67b153e75db6"
  ]

  ```


  To test for picked challenges you need to first set them with Update Metadata Group: Character.

  We abuse the game because it tries to 'fix' the Character because its 'Dirty' and it sends us exactly all the challenges, or more specifically, all the items we have challenges for.

  We also just use the pooled challenges the game chooses, because thats easier.


  We could determine the pciked challenges ourself in the future, but for that we would need to crate our own challenge pools and thats just not important Right now.
